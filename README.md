<b>Introduction:</b> Trend-following trading strategies are based on technical analysis of price-trends of the desired stocks. Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Average Directional Moving Average (ADX) are the main inputs for trend-following strategy.<br>

<b>Brief Description:</b> In this assignment, an optimal SMA-based crossover strategy for our portfolio of stocks is to be selected. In SMA-based crossover strategy, a buy signal is indicated when a short-term SMA crosses over the long-term SMA. Similarly, a sell signal is indicated when the long-term SMA crosses over the short-term SMA. For the purpose of this assignment, the following four stocks were selected for portfolio construction:<br> 
(i) Biogen Inc. (BBIA);<br>
(ii) NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)<br> 
(iii) Netflix (NFLX); and<br> 
(iv) Target Corp (TGT).<br>

Three trading strategies were run, viz., (i) Strategy 1 - Comparison of daily and 50 days SMAs crossover with 50 days and 200 days SMAs crossover;<br>
(ii) Strategy 2- Comparison of 30 days and 180 days SMAs crossover with 50 days and 200 days SMAs crossover as benchmark; and<br>
(iii) Buy and hold strategy for the given stocks.<br>
